Overview
========

Devsus is a script that builds bootable, libre Devuan (http://www.devuan.org/)
images for the Asus C201 Chromebook.

These images contain the latest Chrome OS kernel, deblobbed using the
Linux-libre (http://linux-libre.fsfla.org/) scripts and tuned for smaller size
and better performance.

In addition, the images contain the latest firmware for the freedom-friendly,
Atheros AR9271 based WiFi dongles.

Moreover, the Devuan installation is very minimal and consists of a barebones
Devuan base, plus crucial command-line tools, like those required to connect to
a WiFi network.

Dependencies
============

Devsus has been tested on Devuan 7 (Jessie) on x86_64, with the following
packages installed:

	apt install --no-install-recommends --no-install-suggests \
		parted cgpt \
		git gawk device-tree-compiler vboot-kernel-utils gcc-arm-none-eabi \
			u-boot-tools
		gcc make libc-dev wget g++ cmake \
		binfmt-support qemu-user-static debootstrap

Building
========

  # ./devsus

This produces two disk images:

	1) devuan-jessie-c201-libre-16GB.img, a 16 GB image suitable for persistent
	   installation; its size should be exactly the size of the internal SSD
	2) devuan-jessie-c201-libre-2GB.img, a 2 GB image suitable for booting the
	   laptop off USB

To produce a bootable media, write one of the images to a block device (either a
flash drive or a memory card):

	dd if=devuan-jessie-c201-libre-$SIZE.img of=/dev/$DEVICE bs=50M

The latter (yes, the smaller image) contains the former under /. This way, it is
possible to USB boot the laptop, then install Devuan persistently without having
to download or store the 16 GB image separately.
